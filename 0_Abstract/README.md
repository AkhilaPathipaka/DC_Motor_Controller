### Introduction

Controlling direction and speed of DC motor is very essential in many applications like, Robotic application – to change direction and speed of moving robot. Industrial application – to change direction and speed of rotating machinery· Domestic application – to vary speed of portable fan· Defence application – to rotate radar, automatic gun, tank gun in either direction· Communication application – rotate dish antenna upward – downward or clockwise – anticlockwise. 
  So this project demonstrates how to vary the speed and change the direction of DC motor using AVR microcontroller ATmega328.
